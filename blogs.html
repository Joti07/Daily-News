                    <p class="card-text text-justify">In the early days of JavaScript, there was only one way to declare
                        variables
                        and that was using the var keyword. However, there were some issues associated with variables
                        declared using the var keyword so it was necessary to evolve new ways for variable declaration.
                        With the advent of ES6, now developers are able to define variables according to their specific
                        needs, thanks to two new keywords: let and const.

                        All three of these three keywords have similarities in their syntax for declaring variables.
                        However, they differ in their usage and scope, as detailed in the next section.</p>

                        function?</h5>
                    <p class="card-text text-justify">Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called
                        using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e
                        arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions. Hence, they can never be invoked
                        with the new keyword.Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own this .
                        Arguments objects are not available in arrow functions, but are available in regular functions.
                        Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are 'constructible' and
                        'callable'.

                    <p class="card-text text-justify">
                        .forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change
                        the array and it returns undefined.
                        .map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the
                        updated elements.
                        .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a
                        new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
                        The find() method is used to find all the descendant elements of the selected element. It finds
                        the element in the DOM tree by traversing through the root to leaf.
                        The only difference is the filter() method search through all the elements while find() method
                        search through all the child elements only and the difference between map() and forEach() is the
                        returning value.

                    <p class="card-text text-justify">Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript
                        released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without
                        needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that
                        are complex and contain dynamic elements. Another great thing that comes with template strings
                        are tags. Tags are functions that take a string and the decomposed parts of the string as
                        parameters and are great for converting strings to different entities.
